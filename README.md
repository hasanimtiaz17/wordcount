# Wordcount Program Challenge


There has been several iteration of the base wordcount.py program. Here are the descriptions as follows

## Phase 1

**wordcount_1.py:**This is the first quick code up to with many assumptions in place. This does not take account for punctuation marks, capitalization and other features.This inputs the alice.txt directly from the url
  <br />**wordcount_2.py:**This part only adds a sys input method so the text can be piped through to the program from the local directory.
 <br />**wordcount_3.py:** This part changes all text to lowercase and removes punctuation marks
  <br />**wordcount_4.py:** This part add another layer to ensure all punctuation marks are removed
  
**Map Reduce Implementation** In this part a mapper and reducer was created. In the implementations before this, it was assumed that the program will be stored in system memory. Using a map reduce framework allows the program to be run on a hadoop or Spark environment.

*Output and Documentation** Please refer to the several output files for each run. Output includes the output run from each wordcount version as well as the map reduce version.

## Phase 2

**IN PROGRESS**
 <br />wordcount_5.py: This part is in progress. It will take input text file and prefix and report the text containing that prefix and their counts in new lines. It is using pandas dataframe.


Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## Phase 3

**IN PROGRESS**
